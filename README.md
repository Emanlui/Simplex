# Simplex

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/Emanlui/Simplex)

Simplex method is a linear programming algorithm that optimize a function with certain restrictions.

# Input

It should read a file (.txt) with the following format:

-1 2 1 0 0 4
-1 1 0 1 0 12
-1 -3 0 0 1 0

This is the matrix that the simplex algorithm needs.
